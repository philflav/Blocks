# Blocks

Blocks is a basic Unity 2DGame based on the classic block buster format. 

I've used it as a learning exercise for development in Unity 2D, managing versioing with Git Hub and plan to extend this to deployment on Google Play and maybe IOS/App Store if I ever get my hands on an iPhone.

The game is under constant revision at the time of writing but feel free to clone.

The structure of the game follows some of the ideas shown in https://youtu.be/lqoKWQF-kgs
